"# Churn Prediction MLOps Pipeline" 
"" 
"This is a machine learning operations pipeline for predicting customer churn." 
"" 
"### Live Application" 
"You can view the live application here: https://churn-mlops-pipeline.streamlit.app/" 
"" 
"### Project Structure" 
"" 
"The project is structured into several components to manage the end-to-end MLOps pipeline:" 
"" 
"- **`data/`**: Contains raw and processed datasets." 
"- **`notebooks/`**: Jupyter notebooks for data exploration, modeling, and experimentation." 
"- **`src/`**: Source code for the backend API and the frontend application." 
"- **`models/`**: Stores trained machine learning models, saved as `.pkl` files." 
"- **`front-end/`**: Streamlit code for the user interface." 
"- **`docker-compose.yml`**: Defines the multi-container application (frontend and backend)." 
"- **`Dockerfile`**: Instructions for building the backend and frontend Docker images."

"### Running the Project Locally" 
"" 
"To run the entire pipeline on your local machine using Docker, follow these steps:" 
"" 
"1.  Clone the repository:" 
"    \`\`\`bash" 
"    git clone https://github.com/Assyrian91/churn-mlops-pipeline.git" 
"    \`\`\`" 
"2.  Navigate to the project directory:" 
"    \`\`\`bash" 
"    cd churn-mlops-pipeline" 
"    \`\`\`" 
"3.  Build and run the Docker containers:" 
"    \`\`\`bash" 
"    docker-compose up --build" 
"    \`\`\`" 
"" 
"The frontend application will be accessible at [http://localhost:8501](http://localhost:8501) and the backend API documentation at [http://localhost:8000/docs](http://localhost:8000/docs)."
